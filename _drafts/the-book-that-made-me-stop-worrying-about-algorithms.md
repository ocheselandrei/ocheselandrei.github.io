## Intro

While reading through the Medium newsletters I receive, I noticed a theme about people describing books that influcenced them, and realized I have such a book to share as well.

## Background

Ever since high-school, college, and even a good part of my professional work, I had a problem with the different styles of explanations of more complex algorithms. Some I could understand eventually, some not entirely, and remained feeling a bit shaky about them: why did the presented code or descriptions for some backtracking, dynamic programming, graph algorithms actually worked. The descriptions jumped into the solution, how to represent and go from the input to the output of that problem, with more or less clear steps in the process. But it was not clear how could a regular person invent solutions like that. And each solution seemed coming from a totally different thinking pattern. I felt like there had to be a more "standardized" way of designing an algorithm. So after some frustration and searching, I found just that. A book called "How to think about algorithms".

## The How to Think about Algorithms book

This is a book with children pictures in it and it is intended as course material for undergrad college students. So "serious" algorithm researchers would probably not consider looking at or recommending it.

But for me, it was the most influential book on algorithms I ever read. It shaped the way I currently think about algorithms. It added more tools to my problem solving toolbox. It made me stop feeling anxious and impressed when someone mentions a fancy algorithm. I would strongly recommend this book studied in college instead of current course materials.

I sticked with more takeways from this book than from any other similar book I read. For example, I also went through The Algorithm Design Manual. The only thing I remember from there is the advice to not freeze when presented with a complicated problem. Go through a checklist instead, like plane pilots did when in danger of hitting a quickly approaching mountain. And that is very good advice. But the things I read in the How to Think about Algorithms book sticked even more.

## My takeaways from the book

Loop invariants

Think one step at a time

Trust the process

Dynamic programming is just an optimization technique. Don't be scared or impressed by it.

## Case study

The max-sum problem
